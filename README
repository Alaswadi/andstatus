AndStatus is a light-weight open Twitter alternative for Android. It allows you to read tweets, send Status updates, create Favorites etc. even when you are offline. 

AndStatus is a fork of AndTweet project. The new project was created specifically as a community initiative, not associated with any person, commercial entity and not tied to Twitter only.
