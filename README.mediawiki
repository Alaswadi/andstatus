AndStatus is a light-weight open Twitter and identi.ca client for Android. 
It supports multiple User accounts and allows you to read tweets (timelines and conversations), 
send Status updates and Direct messages, create Favorites etc. even when you are offline or in bad connection conditions. 

AndStatus was created in December 2011 as a fork of [http://code.google.com/p/andtweet/ AndTweet] 
project. The new project was created specifically as a  
[http://andstatus.org community initiative], not associated with any person, commercial entity 
and not tied to Twitter only. 
Since that time the project made substantial progress already, see the [https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/wiki/changelog Change Log].
