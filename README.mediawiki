AndStatus is a light-weight open Twitter alternative for Android.
It supports multiple User accounts and allows you to read tweets, send Status updates, 
create Favorites etc. even when you are offline.

AndStatus is a fork of AndTweet project. 
The new project was created specifically as a community initiative, not associated with any person, 
commercial entity and not tied to Twitter only. 
Since that time the project made substantial progress already, 
see the [https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/wiki/changelog Change Log].
